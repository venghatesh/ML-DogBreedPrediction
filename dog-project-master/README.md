## Project Overview

In this project, we built a pipeline that can can process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  If neither human or dog is provided (eg :like van), it will output a message that it is neither human nor dog.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, we will make important design decisions about the user experience for our app.  we will analyse the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. We will Clone the udacity repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  

4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.


## Project Files


- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output generated by CNN. 
- Any additional images to be used for the testing is placed in appropriate folder.
